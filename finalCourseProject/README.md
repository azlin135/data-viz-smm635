# Introduction

This final course project deals with the genesis and the transformation of Tech City (aka Silicon Roundabout), one of the most prominent technology-based clusters in the world.

# Problem to address

The students are required to jointly use geospatial analysis and dynamic visualization to represent the emergence and transformation of Tech City. The audience is difficult to frame – the visualization should be included in a blog talking about digital technologies and societies.

# Background for the case study

To deliver the project, students may want to:

- conduct a qualitative/historical investigation of the history of Tech city
- appreciate the existence of key events or policy making decisions that could have represented turning points in the lifecycle of Tech City

# Deliverables

Students are required to submit:

1. a html file with the proposed visualization(s)
2. the code/data necessary to reproduce the visualization
3. a companion document that explains the background for the visualization (e.g., literature, white papers, technical reports, design decisions)
